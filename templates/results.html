        <h2>AI Resilience Score: {{ replaceability_percent }}%</h2>
        <div class="score-circle" style="border-top-color: {% if replaceability_percent < 40 %}#4caf50{% elif replaceability_percent < 70 %}#ff9800{% else %}#d32f2f{% endif %}">
            {{ (100 - replaceability_percent)|round(1) }}%
        </div>
        <p>This score represents how resilient your skill set is to AI automation. A higher percentage means your skills are less likely to be replaced by AI.</p>
        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>What Does This Mean?</h3>
            <p>The AI Resilience Score is calculated based on your proficiency in each skill and how replaceable those skills are by AI. A score above 70% indicates strong resilience, while below 40% suggests you may be at higher risk of AI replacement. Your score of {{ (100 - replaceability_percent)|round(1) }}% means that {{ replaceability_percent|round(1) }}% of your skill set is at risk of being replaced by AI.</p>

            </ul>
            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Why Are These Strengths?</h3>
                <p>These skills have a low risk score (≤ 1), meaning they are hard for AI to replace, and you have high proficiency in them. A low risk score is due to a low <strong>replacement rank</strong> (likelihood of AI replacement) and your high proficiency (rated 4-5). Skills with low AI exposure (e.g., 10-20%) are typically human-centric, like emotional intelligence or cultural awareness.</p>

                <p>These skills have a high risk score (> 2), meaning they are more likely to be replaced by AI, and your proficiency in them is relatively low (rated 1-2). A high risk score often comes from a high <strong>replacement rank</strong> (e.g., 80-100) and low proficiency. Improving these skills can reduce your overall risk of AI replacement and boost your AI Resilience Score.</p>

            <h3>How to Interpret This Table</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Proficiency</strong>: Your self-rated skill level (1-5). Higher proficiency reduces your risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Risk Score</strong>: A value from 0 to 4 indicating how vulnerable this skill is to AI replacement. It’s calculated as (Replacement Rank / 100) × (5 - Proficiency). A score above 2 suggests high risk; below 1 indicates low risk.</li>
                <li><strong>AI Exposure</strong>: The percentage of this skill’s tasks that AI can currently handle (0-100%). Higher percentages (e.g., 60-80%) mean AI is already heavily involved, making the skill more replaceable.</li>
                <li><strong>Replacement Rank</strong> (not shown in table but used in Risk Score): A value from 1 to 100, where 100 means the skill is highly replaceable by AI (e.g., "Data Analysis"), and 1 means it’s hard to replace (e.g., "Active Listening").</li>
            </ul>

    <!-- Additional Guidance -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Understanding AI Replacement</h2>
        <p>Skills with a high <strong>Replacement Rank</strong> (e.g., 80-100) and high <strong>AI Exposure</strong> (e.g., 60-80%) are the most likely to be automated by AI. Examples include "Data Analysis" and "Recruitment Automation." These skills often involve repetitive, data-driven tasks that AI excels at.</p>
        <p>Skills with a low <strong>Replacement Rank</strong> (e.g., 1-20) and low <strong>AI Exposure</strong> (e.g., 10-20%) are harder for AI to replace. Examples include "Active Listening" and "Cultural Awareness," which require human traits like empathy and cultural understanding.</p>
        <p><strong>Actionable Advice</strong>: Focus on improving your proficiency in high-risk skills (listed above) to reduce your vulnerability. Leverage your strengths in low-risk skills to stay competitive against AI.</p>
